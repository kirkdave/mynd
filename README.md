# Mynd

_Mynd: Go, Get, Become_

Set of scripts to configure macOS in the way I like, install applications and packages and generally get me up and running quicker

Very much set up and configured for myself, if others find it useful great but you will definitely want to take it as a fork and modify it for your needs
